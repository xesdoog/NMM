## Usage

- Compile the project *(will provide a pre-compiled binary at some point in the future)*. It will produce a binary: `NoMansMenu.dll`.
- Start the game, preferably load into a save as well.
- Use any injector and inject the DLL into `NMS.exe`.
- Press `INSERT` to open/close the menu.

### Known Issues

- **First ever** injection tanks your CPU ü•¥ After that, patterns get cached and the menu loads instantly.
- Sometimes, initial injection fails with `Invalid Vulkan Device` error. Restarting the game and re-injecting the DLL works. Not sure how to fix this.

### TODO

- [ ] Add more stuff and hopefully make sense of some of this game's huge classes (Im not a reverse-engineer. [HELP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw8TCw42hZo)).
- [ ] Add a GitHub workflow to compile the project and upload a binary.
- [ ] Add serializable settings *(checkbox states, maybe themes and UI stuff?)*.
